Building Shipper

Assuming you have Go installed and the *GOPATH* environment variable properly defined:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: build.sh
    :name: shipper_build_sh

    mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/bookingcom
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bookingcom
    git clone git@github.com:bookingcom/shipper.git
    go build cmd/shipper
